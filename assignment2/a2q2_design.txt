Function: 'calculate_position'
 - Function description: Calculate the final (x, y) position based on a series of directions.
 - Pseudocode algorithm:

    """
    Set initial x, y coordinates to 0, 0

    For each line in line from file
        If direction is north
            Add 1 to y
        If direction is south
            Subtract 1 from y
        If direction is east
            Add 1 to x
        If direction is west
            Subtract 1 from x
        Else return starting position

    Return x, y coordinates -> (x, y)
    """

 - Inputs:
    - "directions" (string): A string of characters where each character represents a direction (N, S, E, W).

 - Outputs:
    - A tuple (x, y) representing the final position on a plane after following the directions.

 - Test cases:
    - Test Case 1: Input string "NNE"
        - Expected output: (1, 2)
    - Test Case 2: Input string "NNE\nSSW"
        - Expected output: (1, 2), (-1, -2)
    - Test Case 3: Empty line
        - Expected output: (0, 0)


Function: 'read_file'
 - Function description: Read a file containing lines of directions and return a list of calculated positions.
 - Pseudocode algorithm:

    """
    Initialize empty list

    Open file name as file
        For each line in the file
            Strip whitespaces from line
            Create variable = result of send line to 'calculate_position' function
            Append variable to empty list

    Return list of coordinate pairs -> [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]
    """

 - Inputs:
    - file_path (string): The path to the text file containing lines of directions.

 - Outputs:
    - A list of tuples, where each tuple represents the final (x, y) position calculated from a line of directions in the file.

 - Test cases:
    - Test Case 1: File with single line "NNESE"
        - Expected output: (2, 1)
    - Test Case 2: File with multiple lines "NNE\nSSW"
        - Expected output: [(1, 2), (-1, -2)]
    - Test Case 3: Empty file
        - Expected output: []


Function: 'display_results'
 - Function description: Print each ordered pair of coordinates to the console.
 - Pseudocode algorithm:

    """
    For each coordinate pair (x, y) in list of coordinate pairs
        Print coordinate pair
    """

 - Inputs:
    - ordered_pairs (list of tuples): A list where each tuple represents an (x, y) position.

 - Outputs:
    - None.

 - Test cases:
    - Test Case 1: Input list [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
        - Expected output:
            (1, 2)
            (3, 4)
    - Test Case 2: Input list [(0, 0)]
        - Expected output:
            (0, 0)
    - Test Case 3: Empty list []
        - Expected output: No output


Function: 'main()'
 - Function description: Main function to run the program. Handles user input, file reading, and displaying results.
 - Pseudocode algorithm:

    """
    Get filename
    Capture in variable result of send filename to read_file() function
    Send returned list to display_results()
    """

 - Inputs:
    - None.

 - Outputs:
    - None.

  - Test cases:
    - Test Case 1: Input filename with contents "NNE\nSSW"
        - Expected output:
            (1, 2)
            (-1, -2)
    - Test Case 2: Input file name with no contents
        - Expected output: No output
